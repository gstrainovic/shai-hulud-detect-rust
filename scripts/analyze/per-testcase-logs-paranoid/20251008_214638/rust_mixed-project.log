  SHAI-HULUD + PARANOID SECURITY REPORT
==============================================

⚠️  MEDIUM RISK: Suspicious content patterns:
   - Pattern: webhook.site reference
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/mixed-project/suspicious.js
   NOTE: Manual review required to determine if these are malicious.

⚠️  MEDIUM RISK (PARANOID): Network exfiltration patterns detected:
   - Warning: Suspicious domain found: webhook.site:   webhookUrl: "https://webhook.site/some-other-endpoint",
     Found in: /c/Users/gstra/Code/rust-scanner/shai-hulud-detect/test-cases/mixed-project/suspicious.js
   NOTE: These patterns may indicate data exfiltration or communication with C2 servers.
   Review network connections and data flows carefully.

==============================================
🔍 SUMMARY:
   High Risk Issues: 0
   Medium Risk Issues: 2
   Low Risk (informational): 1
   Total Critical Issues: 2

⚠️  IMPORTANT:
   - High risk issues likely indicate actual compromise
   - Medium risk issues require manual investigation
   - Low risk issues are likely false positives from legitimate code
   - Issues marked (PARANOID) are general security checks, not Shai-Hulud specific
   - Consider running additional security scans
   - Review your npm audit logs and package history
